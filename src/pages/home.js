                    my name is roman. i currently live in beautiful berlin, germany. some might find that berlin isn't a nice city, but that really depends on how you experience your surroundings.
                    i find berlin very inspiring, both personally and for my development projects.

                    i am a self-taught software developer, i learned both ios development (swiftui + uikit) and web development (reactjs). due to my work as a product manager, i also have a strong foundation in ui/ux development and design. 
                </p>

                { /* what i do */}
                <HeaderSmall>what i do</HeaderSmall>
                <p>
                    when developing, i mostly do the whole workflow from ideation, user stories and workflows, over wireframes, mockups and animations, to development and deployment.

                    <br></br><br></br>

                    i find that following an agile process with kanban boards works best for me when doing my own projects, but i also enjoy working in sprints when working on projects for my 9-5.
